# Weekly Sprint Reports Format

## Instructions

You are being asked to write a weekly sprint report for Karim and Morgan (the founders). These reports are casual check-ins to stay aligned on tasks, client work, finances, and design trends. They should be quick to read (2 pages max) and helpful for planning.

There are two types of sprint reports:
1. **Monday Kickoff** - What's coming up this week
2. **Friday Recap** - What got done this week

## What to Include

### 1. **Tasks Overview**
- High-level tasks for Karim
- High-level tasks for Morgan
- What's up next for client work

### 2. **Financial Snapshot**
- Credit card spend (past week + past month)
- Revenue coming in
- Quick income vs expenses summary

### 3. **Design Trends**
- 2-3 interesting design or AI trends from the week
- Can be tools, techniques, or inspiration

## Data Sources

Use these to gather information:
- **Notion**: Pull task lists, project statuses, and financial data directly
- **Web Search**: Find latest design/AI trends if needed
- **Claude Knowledge**: Reference saved design news sources

## Workflow

1. **Access Notion**: Pull task data for Karim and Morgan
2. **Check finances**: Get credit card spend and revenue from Notion
3. **Find trends**: Search for design/AI news or reference Claude knowledge
4. **Write the report**: Follow the format below
5. **Keep it casual**: This is for the founders, not external stakeholders

## Style Guidelines

- **Tone**: Casual and conversational. Write like you're texting the team.
- **Length**: 2 pages max. Be concise and scannable.
- **Emojis**: Use them! Makes it more fun and visual.
- **Data**: Pull real numbers from Notion - don't make them up.
- **Trends**: Keep design/AI section brief (2-3 sentences per item).
- **Honesty**: If things are behind or over budget, say it clearly.

## Tips

- **Monday kickoffs** should feel motivating and clear about priorities
- **Friday recaps** should celebrate wins and flag any concerns
- **Financial data** should come directly from Notion - be accurate
- **Design trends** can be high-level - no need for deep dives
- **Client work** should be specific about deliverables and deadlines
- **Use checkmarks** (✅) for completed items and (⏳) for in-progress
- **Be honest about blockers** - better to flag early than miss deadlines
- **Keep it positive** - even when reporting challenges, maintain an upbeat tone
