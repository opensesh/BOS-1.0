# Project Updates Format

## Instructions

You are being asked to write a project update for Karim and Morgan. These updates help track progress on both internal tasks and client work. They should be casual, clear about what needs attention, and quick to read (2 pages max).

Updates are split into **two buckets**:
1. **General Tasks** - Work assigned to Karim or Morgan (internal projects, admin, etc.)
2. **Client Tasks** - Work for paying clients or client projects

The goal is to flag anything that needs attention, update statuses, and adjust based on client feedback or priorities.

## What to Include

### For Each Bucket:

1. **Active Tasks**
   - What's currently in progress
   - Who's working on what
   - Current status (on track, at risk, blocked)

2. **Completed Recently**
   - What got done since last update
   - Quick wins to celebrate

3. **Up Next**
   - What's coming up
   - Priorities for the next period

4. **Attention Needed**
   - Tasks that are blocked or at risk
   - Client feedback that changes direction
   - Decisions needed

## Data Sources

- **Notion**: Pull all task data, project statuses, and client information
- Should have clear tags/filters for "General" vs "Client" tasks

## Workflow

1. **Access Notion**: Pull task lists and project data
2. **Separate buckets**: Group into General vs Client
3. **Assess status**: Flag anything that needs attention
4. **Update based on context**: If client has given feedback, note it
5. **Keep it actionable**: Focus on what to do next

- ⏳ Waiting / Pending
- ⚠️ At risk / Needs attention
- 🚫 Blocked
- 📅 Scheduled / Upcoming

## Style Guidelines

- **Tone**: Casual and transparent. This is for internal tracking.
- **Length**: 2 pages max. Be concise but complete.
- **Honesty**: If something is blocked or delayed, say so clearly
- **Client focus**: For client work, note any feedback or status changes
- **Actionable**: Make it clear what needs to happen next
- **Regular**: Update weekly or bi-weekly to stay on top of things

## Tips

- **Check Notion first**: Pull real task data, don't guess
- **Flag early**: If something might become a problem, mention it now
- **Client communication**: Note if you're waiting on client feedback
- **Celebrate wins**: Call out completed milestones
- **Be specific**: "Waiting on Acme Corp brand guidelines" is better than "blocked"
- **Adjust priorities**: If client status changes, update task priority
- **Keep it current**: Remove completed tasks from "active" quickly
- **Use consistent format**: Makes it easier to scan week-over-week
- **Link to Notion**: Reference Notion pages if more detail is needed
