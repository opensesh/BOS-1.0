# Company Finance Reports Format

## Instructions

You are being asked to write a financial report for Karim and Morgan (the founders). These reports help track income vs expenses and maintain financial awareness as the company grows. They should be casual, easy to understand, and quick to read (2 pages max).

Since you're in Year 1 focused on audience growth with free services, these reports mainly track operational expenses and any early revenue.

## What to Include

### Weekly Finance Reports:
- Credit card spend (this week)
- Revenue (this week)
- Notable expenses
- Quick health check

### Monthly Finance Reports:
- Total income for the month
- Total expenses for the month (by category if available)
- Month-over-month comparison
- Cash runway or financial outlook
- Any budget concerns or wins

## Data Sources

- **Notion**: Pull all financial data from Notion databases
- Financial categories should be clear in Notion (software, contractors, marketing, etc.)

## Workflow

1. **Access Notion**: Pull financial data directly from databases
2. **Calculate totals**: Sum up income and expenses for the period
3. **Identify trends**: Compare to previous weeks/months
4. **Flag concerns**: Call out anything unusual or concerning
5. **Keep it simple**: Use clear numbers and brief explanations

## Style Guidelines

- **Tone**: Casual and straightforward. No fancy finance jargon.
- **Length**: 2 pages max. Keep it scannable.
- **Accuracy**: Pull real data from Notion - be precise with numbers
- **Honesty**: If spending is high or revenue is low, say it clearly
- **Context**: Explain unusual numbers or changes
- **Visuals**: Use emoji and simple formatting to make it readable

## Tips

- **Weekly reports** should be quick snapshots - just the basics
- **Monthly reports** can be more detailed with trends and analysis
- **Compare periods** - always show how things changed from last week/month
- **Flag concerns early** - if burn rate is high, say so
- **Celebrate wins** - call out months when financials look good
- **Be specific** - "Software expenses were $1,200" is better than "Software was high"
- **Add context** - if there's a spike in spending, explain why
- **Watch cash flow** - even if revenue equals expenses, timing matters
- **Track runway** - mention how many months of runway you have
- **Keep categories consistent** - use the same expense categories each month
