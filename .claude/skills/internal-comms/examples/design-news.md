## Example Design News

```
# 🎨 Design News - Week of Oct 21, 2025

## AI & Tech

**Anthropic Launches Prompt Caching**
Claude now caches long prompts to save time and costs. Huge for design workflows with style guides or brand docs - you can load your entire design system once and reuse it. Should test this with our client brand guidelines.
🔗 [anthropic.com/news/prompt-caching]

**OpenAI Canvas Drops**
New interface for ChatGPT that lets you edit AI output inline. Feels like Google Docs meets AI - could be great for copywriting with clients. Worth trying for web content.
🔗 [openai.com/canvas]

**Microsoft Designer Gets Copilot**
Microsoft's Canva competitor now has AI image generation built in. Not as good as Figma yet, but getting there. Watching to see if this becomes a threat.

---

## Design Tools

**Framer Variables Are Here**
Finally! Framer now has proper design variables (colors, spacing, etc). Makes component libraries actually maintainable. We should rebuild our component system with these.
🔗 [framer.com/updates/variables]

**Figma Dev Mode Updates**
New inspect panel makes handoff to developers way cleaner. Shows CSS, React, and iOS code automatically. Clients with dev teams will love this.
🔗 [figma.com/dev-mode]

**Webflow Localization Launch**
Multi-language sites just got way easier in Webflow. Could open up international clients for us. Worth learning.

---

## Inspiration

**Portfolio: Alex Smecher**
Incredible portfolio site with mind-bending scroll animations. Uses Framer with custom code. The transitions between projects are *chef's kiss*. Might steal some ideas for our own portfolio update.
🔗 [alexsmecher.com] (made up example)

**Awwwards: Stripe Sessions Site**
Stripe's conference site won site of the day. Super clean, motion is subtle but effective. Love the color palette and how they handle text hierarchy. Could work well for tech clients.
🔗 [awwwards.com/stripe-sessions]

**GSAP ScrollTrigger Tutorial**
Found a great tutorial on advanced scroll animations with GSAP. Been wanting to level up on animation - this looks like the guide to finally learn it properly.

---

## Quick Takes

• Variable fonts are having a moment - seeing them everywhere
• Everyone's doing gradient meshes now (might be overdone soon?)
• Framer is eating Webflow's lunch for interactive sites
• AI-generated placeholder images are getting scary good

---

💡 **Worth Exploring This Week:** Test out Framer Variables on a small project. Could save hours on future client work.

# 🎨 Design News - AI Tool Roundup

Quick update because there's been a flurry of AI tool launches this week:

## New AI Tools for Designers

**v0 by Vercel**
Text-to-UI tool that's actually good. Type a description, get a React component. Worth playing with for rapid prototyping.
🔗 [v0.dev]

**Galileo AI Updates**
Their design-to-code got way better. Still not perfect but can save time on simple layouts.

**Recraft v3**
New AI image generator specifically trained on design assets. Better than Midjourney for UI work.

---

💡 Quick take: AI tools are finally becoming actually useful for design (not just gimmicks). Worth spending a day testing these out.
